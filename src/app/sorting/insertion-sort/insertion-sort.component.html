    <h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
   <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages:<br><br>

    -Simple implementation: Jon Bentley shows a three-line C version, and a five-line optimized version. <br>
    -Efficient for (quite) small data sets, much like other quadratic sorting algorithms.<br>
    -More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort.<br>
    -Adaptive, i.e., efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted: the time complexity is O(kn) when each element in the input is no more than k places away from its sorted position.<br>
    -Stable; i.e., does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.<br>
    -In-place; i.e., only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space.<br>
    -Online; i.e., can sort a list as it receives it.<br>

When people manually sort cards in a bridge hand, most use a method that is similar to insertion sort.</p>
